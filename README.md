# webinstans
This is a web interface to INSTANS. You can specify the parameters for INSTANS and launch it. When INSTANS is running, the web interface shows the output of the execution. You can trace the execution to see, how the RETE algorithm traverses through the RETE network changing the contents of the memories and indices.

Note! Currently this uses branch 'hash-immutable-tokens' of instans, and it does not work with master.
